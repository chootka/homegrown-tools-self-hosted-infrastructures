# Afterhours

Course materials for Afterhours, Spring 2026 at [School of Machines](https://schoolofma.org/) / ACUD MACHT NEU, Berlin.

## About

This course explores how to develop your own digital tools, from self-hosted services to custom scripts and alternative infrastructure. Moving beyond being passive users of corporate platforms, we learn to set up our own servers, networks, AI systems, and communication tools. Questions around control of data, software, hardware and infrastructure are tied to larger themes of autonomy, resilience, and community self-sufficiency. An ethos of artistry and activism is infused throughout as students develop their own toolkit of custom tools, self-hosted services, and alternative infrastructure.

No previous experience is necessary.
